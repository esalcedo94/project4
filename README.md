# sneakfreaks - Sneaker React + Rails App
made by Eduardo Salcedo and Chris Bellaro

We created this app with a Ruby-on-Rails back-end using postgresql for our database and incorporated full CRUD. For the front-end we used React. We also incorporated Bootstrap CSS framework for styling the buttons, while we decided to style the rest of the page manually.

For our user story we wanted a user to be able to see the index page, as well as edit shoes and delete their shoes in their collection.

One challenge we encountered but were able to overcome was the disparity in our Ruby versions. We were able to get on the same version using rbenv. Another issue we were able to resolve was nesting inputs inside of Bootstrap's buttons. This issue would create a smaller button within a button, with the larger not working. We used CSS to solve this issue by forcing the width to take up the entire button.

Some things we'd like to incorporate in the future would be more images (for each shoe, maybe some in the background), and getting forms to work with Bootstrap.
